        Henry Ford once said, "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said 'faster
        horses.'" Recognizing that the era of social media without connected wallets — a time when
        both users' attention and influencers' content were free — has passed, we built AlemX. In an
        innovative response to the digital age, where users' attention is the most valuable
        resource, AlemX introduces its own Proof-of-Attention (PoA) protocol.
